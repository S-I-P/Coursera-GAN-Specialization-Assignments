# Coursera GAN Specialization Assignments
My programming assignments for the 3-part [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) course offered by deeplearning.ai in Coursera. The three courses are:

1. [Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans?specialization=generative-adversarial-networks-gans)
1. [Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-better-generative-adversarial-networks-gans?specialization=generative-adversarial-networks-gans)
1. [Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apply-generative-adversarial-networks-gans?specialization=generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

Note: I accidentally did not download the programming assignment for week 2 of the second course before my subscription ended. Hence, C2W2_Assignment is missing.
